Mathematica code for Community ecology and soil biogeochemistry

The Mathematica code will recreate the data used to produce Fig. 5. Modifying parameter values as decribed in the Supplemental Information will produce the data in supplemental figures.

The model results file contains the full results used to produce Fig. 5 and the addition results excluded from the analysis presented in the manuscript (i.e. extinction, competative exclusion).
